# Reproducible Research

> There is no such thing as "reproducible science", there is just "science" and "not science". <br>
> -- <cite>Someone on Twitter</cite>

## Reproducibility

Ideally:

- Lab notebook available
- Data on Figshare
- Code on GitHub/Bitbucket (and Figshare)
- Preprint on a preprint server


# Reproducible Research in Practice

> In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is.
> -- <cite>Jan L. A. van de Snepscheut</cite>


## Challenges | Reproducibility isn't free

- Making sure your research is 100% reproducible is a lot of work.
- This takes time and effort. (see [Reproducibility isn't free](https://ropensci.org/blog/2014/06/09/reproducibility/) by FitzJohn *et al.*)
- Even if you are convinced, is your PI / supervisor? Their boss?

## Challenges | Reproducibility isn't compelling

[Nice post](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/02/correctness-isnt-compelling.html) by Greg Wilson in the context of [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org).

- ~ 5 mio articles published between 1990-2000
- Of these ~ 100 retracted for "computational irreproducibility"
- Chances that your paper is retracted: 1 : 5 000 000
- If a paper takes ~ 8 months to write, assuming a 48 hour week, this only justifies spending an extra **115 seconds** for reproducibility
